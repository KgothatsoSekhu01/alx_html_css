## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository or download the project files.**
2. **Ensure you have a modern web browser for testing.**

## Figma Design

You can access the design file on Figma [here](link-to-figma).

### Fonts

If the fonts used in the design are not available on your system, download them from:
- [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- [Spin Cycle OT](link-to-font)

## Setup Instructions

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the project.
2. Ensure that all images are placed in the `images/` directory.
3. The CSS file is linked in the HTML file, so any changes to styles should be made in `styles.css`.

## Important Notes

- Some values in the Figma design are in floats; feel free to round them for implementation.
- Make sure to verify the design details and adjust any HTML code as necessary (e.g., adding images for logos).
